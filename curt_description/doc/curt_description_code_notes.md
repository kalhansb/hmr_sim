# joystick.yaml — design notes and history

The long comments of `config/joystick.yaml`, moved out of the code on 2026-09-23 so the source carries short comments only. Where a comment was moved, the code keeps a short gist ending in `(notes: <id>)`; the section headed `<id>` below holds the original comment, word for word.

Sections follow the order of the source file and are grouped by the function (or section) they sit in. Each gives the line of code the comment was attached to and its original line number. Line numbers, dates, generation numbers and cross-references inside the moved text are as they were when written; they record history and are not maintained.
